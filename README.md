libgdx-jython-tests
===================

A port of the expansive libGDX test code to Jython, to help others interested in
experimenting with Jython for more serious game development.

Status:
-------

Currently in the early stages, with one successful test running.

Setup:
------

1. Obtain the libGDX JARs (nightly builds can be found here):

- https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/

2. Set up JARs in a lib/ directory at the base of the installation.

3. Reference said libs by appending them to sys.path at the start of any test you would
like to run or create yourself!

4. Profit.
